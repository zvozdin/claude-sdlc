# /sdlc:doctor

Snapshot of the pipeline's runtime environment. Reuses the same Step 0a preflight code-path that `/sdlc:start` runs on every invocation, but in a read-only mode that never aborts.

## What this command does

1. **Locate the runtime dependencies file.** Try these paths in order, take the first that exists:
   - `~/.claude/plugins/cache/sdlc/runtime-dependencies.json`
   - `<repo>/plugins/sdlc/runtime-dependencies.json` (development checkout)

   If neither exists, print `🔌 Dependency preflight: no runtime-dependencies.json found.` and skip step 2.

2. **Run the same preflight algorithm as Step 0a in `pipeline-orchestrator/SKILL.md`** (Step 0a-2 through 0a-3 — enumerate available skills via `mcp__skills__list_skills` with FS fallback to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/{plugin}/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`, then compute per-dependency status). DO NOT enforce policy in `/sdlc:doctor` — `block` does NOT exit here. Just collect status.

3. **Locate active stack profiles.** Reuse Step 0b logic from the orchestrator: `Glob ~/.claude/plugins/cache/**/stack.md`, parse frontmatter, evaluate detect rules against the current project. Identify the primary profile that would be selected.

4. **Read cost baseline (if present).** Try `<repo>/docs/cost-baseline.md`. If it has a fenced JSON block tagged `summary` (e.g. ```` ```json summary ````) parse and extract `avg_cost_per_medium_run_usd`, `p90_cost_per_medium_run_usd`, `cache_hit_ratio`, `runs_aggregated`. Otherwise show the raw "not yet baselined" notice.

5. **Render output.** Default = human-readable table. With `--json` flag, emit a single valid JSON object to stdout and exit.

🩺 SDLC Doctor

Dependencies (from runtime-dependencies.json):
  superpowers >=1.0.0 [policy=warn]
    status: ✅ available
    skills: thinking-deeply, test-driven-development, verification-before-completion

  acme-internal >=2.0.0 [policy=block]
    status: ❌ missing
    missing skills: code-style, internal-api-style
    install:
      /plugin marketplace add acme/internal-tools
      /plugin install acme-internal@acme-internal-tools

Stack profiles:
  🎯 active: laravel (priority=100, from laravel-plugin/stack.md)
  also installed: vanilla (priority=0)

Cost baseline (docs/cost-baseline.md, last updated 2026-05-04, 22 runs):
  avg medium-run: $1.62
  p90 medium-run: $2.31
  cache hit ratio: 0.61

Heads-up:
  ❌ 1 blocking dependency missing — /sdlc:start would abort.
     Run the install commands above, then retry.
```

If a section is absent (no baseline file, no missing deps, etc.) say so explicitly with one line — never silently omit a section.

## JSON output format (`--json`)

```json
{
  "deps_preflight": {
    "superpowers": {
      "status": "available",
      "policy": "warn",
      "missing_skills": []
    },
    "acme-internal": {
      "status": "missing",
      "policy": "block",
      "missing_skills": ["code-style", "internal-api-style"],
      "install_command": [
        "/plugin marketplace add acme/internal-tools",
        "/plugin install acme-internal@acme-internal-tools"
      ]
    }
  },
  "stack": {
    "active_profile": "laravel",
    "primary_priority": 100,
    "all_installed": ["vanilla", "laravel"]
  },
  "cost_baseline": {
    "available": true,
    "runs_aggregated": 22,
    "avg_cost_per_medium_run_usd": 1.62,
    "p90_cost_per_medium_run_usd": 2.31,
    "cache_hit_ratio": 0.61,
    "last_updated": "2026-05-04"
  },
  "would_abort_pipeline": true
}
```

`would_abort_pipeline` is `true` iff any dependency with `policy=block` is missing.

## Hard rules

- **Read-only.** Do NOT install plugins, run pipelines, or write files (other than transient log lines to stdout/stderr).
- **Do not enforce policy.** A missing `block` dep here is just reported, not actioned.
- **Reuse, don't reimplement.** The dependency-status algorithm is described in `pipeline-orchestrator/SKILL.md` Step 0a-2 / 0a-3. If those steps change, this command's behavior must follow — this command is documentation that delegates to those steps, not a parallel implementation.
- **Exit code semantics with `--json`:** exit 0 normally; exit 1 only if the runtime-dependencies.json file itself is malformed JSON (parse error). Missing-but-blocking deps still exit 0 — report them in the JSON and let the caller decide.

## When to use

- After installing or updating a stack plugin — verify external dep wiring still resolves.
- Before kicking off a long pipeline run — confirm `/sdlc:start` won't abort at Step 0a.
- In CI / automation — `/sdlc:doctor --json` gives a machine-checkable health report.
- When a cost regression is suspected — compare current `cost_baseline` against historical values.
