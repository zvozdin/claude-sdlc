# fastapi-plugin

FastAPI backend + database stack provider for the `claude-sdlc` marketplace.

This is an **API-only** plugin. FastAPI does not render server-side HTML templates. SPA frontends (Vue, React) connect to the FastAPI application via the API contract that `fastapi-architect` designs and documents. The frontend aspect is handled by whichever frontend plugin is active (`vue-plugin`, `react-plugin`, etc.).

| `fastapi-conventions` | `fastapi-plugin:fastapi-conventions` | APIRouter structure, Pydantic v2 schemas, `Depends` dependency chain, OAuth2/JWT, `pydantic-settings`, lifespan, `HTTPException` handling |
| `sqlalchemy-patterns` | `fastapi-plugin:sqlalchemy-patterns` | SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped`/`mapped_column` declarative models, `AsyncSession`, relationships with explicit lazy loading, Alembic integration |

Also reuses:

- `python-foundation:python-conventions`

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Role |
|---|---|
| `sdlc` | Core pipeline orchestration |
| `python-foundation` | Python conventions, tooling, and pytest patterns |

## Installation

```bash
# From the claude-sdlc marketplace root
claude plugin install fastapi-plugin
```

The plugin activates automatically when `fastapi` is found in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.

## API-only note

FastAPI is an API-only framework — `fastapi-architect` produces no server-rendered HTML. When a SPA frontend plugin (`vue-plugin`, `react-plugin`) is also active, `fastapi-architect` writes an explicit **API contract** section in `docs/plans/{task_slug}/02-development.md` describing each endpoint path, HTTP method, and Pydantic request/response schema. The frontend architect reads this contract to implement the UI.
